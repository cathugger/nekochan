when delivered via NNTP:
0. receive from NNTP.
1. store in file or ram whole.
2. scan if valid. if not, ban and stop there.
3. nntp process - rewrite top headers
3.1. do not peek into insides, store in outgoing cache.
3.1.1. broadcast thru NNTP.
3.2. peek into insides, extract everything, add to database.
3.2.1. broadcast thru non-NNTP channels.

speedup?
maybe we should instantly rewrite top headers first upon reception?
would make disc IO smaller.
probably yes.
top header rewrite would only really change Path header and strip Xref.
yes should do that, as it should be fast enough.
at the same time we can check whether article is suitable for us and send
rejection message before client finishes sending whole article -- double bonus.

we still should broadcast article to other servers only when we have validated it.
validation includes CNTP0, and possibly check to ensure that format matches our desired article structure (NOT SURE ABOUT THIS!).
