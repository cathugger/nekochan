commands:

XLISTEN: setup listening filters
params:
  XLISTEN * -- listen all groups
  XLISTEN groupname.*,groupname2.* -- wildmat selection
returns:
  ??? - OK
  ??? - filter rejected because too complicated or too long (and instead * is applied)
XXX:
  we should have mode where we send \n separated list of filters.
  would allow to fit much more filtered groups.

XWAIT: actually do waiting
params: none
returns initial:
  ??? - OK [and then waits for event or timeout]
  ??? - listen facility is currently unavailable [final]
returns final:
  ??? - event arrived
  ??? - interrupted by client
  ??? - timeout
  ??? - listen facility internal error

XCANCEL: interrupt current XWAIT
info: actually any command can interrupt XWAIT, but this one is specifically designed for that, without side-effects
params: none
returns:
  ??? - interrupted
  ??? - no XWAIT was running
