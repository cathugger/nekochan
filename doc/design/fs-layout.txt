work - main dir
work/psqlib - psqlib backend files
work/psqlib/src - main source files storage
work/psqlib/thm - main thumbnails storage
work/psqlib/src/_/{node} - private individual service files
work/psqlib/src/_/{node}/tmp - temporary files (clear on startup/shutdown)
work/psqlib/src/_/{node}/pre-add - staging area for files being added
work/psqlib/src/_/{node}/pre-del - staging/backup area for files being deleted
work/psqlib/nntp - main netnews articles cache storage

for src, we could have several layouts:
 - flat:
   all files in one folder, factor 1
 - b36-36:
   36 directories, factor 36
 - b36-1296:
   1296 directories, factor 1296
 - b36-36-36:
   36 directories, 36 subdirectories, factor 1296
 - b36-36-1296:
   36 directories, 1296 subdirectories, factor 46656
unfortunately, using values like 36*36/4=324 would make it harder to work with, so it was omitted.
one of intended use cases is transparently rewriting queries from flat layout to nested one inside nginx.
layout would preferably be picked so that there are around 1000 files per dir.
upto 10k should be fine; more - depending on filesystem;
iirc XFS doesn't recommend going over 100k with default settings.
having only 5 files per dir would v likely be inefficient so don't pick overkill values.
