idea:

when new thread gets made, recheck against current view which is <= Date hdr of $current_article
if article gets reply to existing thread which isn't marked as `should_prune`, just normally bump.
if article gets reply to existing thread which is marked as `should_prune`, it should check that article's date is between thread's `last_normal_bump` and `prunelimit`.
`prunelimit` is date-like variable describing before which date insert could save thread from getting pruned.
after `prunelimit`, thread would be already slided off and couldn't be bumped anymore.
on post delete, recheck thread against view of <=deleted_post_date, then if its to be pruned, recalc bump time, reassign `prunelimit` var
