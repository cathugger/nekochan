<p>Ok, so my point was lost on you.  I'll go a little futher to try and help
 you understand.</p>

<p>We have been working for <em>years</em> to "fix" a large number of
 binary-on-usenet problems.  Usenet is very hard to change because it
 involves so many indepent organizations (news sites, server developers,
 newsreader developers, and end-users) that all have their own problems they
 want to see addressed.</p>

<p>If you had spent the past 10 years in this group like I and many others
 have, you would have seen all the discussions and ideas that have been
 debated.  And you would have seen all the work going on to help change
 things as well.  Servers have been converted to allow binary data to move
 on Usenet, but some still remain.  Lots of ideas have been debated, and
 tested in prototype to see which options would be best for encoding binary
 data once Usenet was ready to carry it.  The only reason yEnc can work at
 all is because of the years of work that went in to converting usenet from
 a text transport system into a binary transport system (but we weren't
 done).</p>

<p>We had 10 or 20 problems we were trying to "fix" with a new standard, but
 had only found workable solutions to maybe 8 of them.  We could have
 stopped at any time and created a new standard to fix the 8 problems we
 knew how to fix, but we knew that once a new standard was put in place,
 usenet would be stuck with it for the next 20 years.  Fixing only 8 of the
 problems didn't seem good enough to us to justify being stuck with the
 solution for what could be the rest of our lives (some of us are old hacks
 already).</p>

<p>Then Juergen comes along and suggests yEnc.  It only fixes 2 of the 20
 problems.  And, it was a poorly designed fix at that.  The standard
 document he wrote was full of problems that would lead to people creating
 incompatible encoders and decoders.  It was nothing more than a joke
 compared to the other work in progress.</p>

<p>But the damn thing got leaked out to the "public" anyway and started to
 catch on because the users really liked the 2 things it fixed for them.  By
 the time we realized it was going to actually take off, it was too late to
 fix anything.  The incompatible encoders were already in the wild and being
 used.  The developers that just had to spend time adding "yEnc" support to
 their software were not interested in adding "yEnc II" only a month later.
 And most the changes that were really needed would be incompatable with the
 current decoders.  We just missed the boat because we didn't believe the
 thing could float.</p>

<p>Like always on Usenet, the standard will develop on it's own now by all the
 developers "hacking until it works".  But now Usenet has seen what we
 already knew.  Converting Usenet to a new encoding system is a painful,
 slow, and expensive processes.  Look at how much time out for life has been
 wasted in this thread alone on yEnc?  Multiply that by the millions of
 users that have had to "deal" with yEnc.  Now, tell me how many of them are
 going to be willing to convert to yet another new standard 2 years from now
 (when the conversion to yEnc still isn't finished)?</p>

<p>yEnc is good for the 2 things it "fixed" (uuencode overhead, the lack of
 CRCs to identify corrupted data).  yEnc is bad because it has closed the
 door on any other new fixes for probably at least another 10 years - new
 fixes which we already had workable solutions for (like automatcially
 identifying and combining reposts without the user having to think at all,
 like allowing news servers to "fix" all the missing part problem by
 filtering posts by file size instead of by article size, like having a way
 to detect corrupted articles for all types of posts - not just yEnc posts,
 like having workable extenstions to NNTP to allow newsreaders to download
 lists of "files" instead of having to download thousands of duplicate
 headers, like having news readers be able to know the true "file name" and
 "hash" of a file before the 500 parts are downloaded to prevent users from
 having to download duplicates, like allowing NNTP newsreaders do download
 file attachements in pure binary and not have to deal with any type of
 "encoding" system. etc, etc, etc).</p>

<p>Enjoy the 2 fixes you got with yEnc, you aren't likely to see the other 10
 we were working on for a very very long time.  Nobody here has even been
 talking about that stuff since yEnc took over.</p>

<p>yEnc itself is a hack job, but it's not "bad".  What's bad is the fact that
 with its release, we have lost the one opportunity we had to do so much
 more.</p>

<p>Maybe we never would have gotten any of those other "good ideas" out the
 door.  So maybe it's good that yEnc is here.  A "bird in hand" and all
 that.  But just understand what opportunities were lost once yEnc took
 over.  It's that loss of opportunity that most people are talking about
 when they say "yEnc is bad".</p>

<p>Usenet is neat because it has a life of it's own.  It envolves in
 directions that no one expects at times. yEnc is just one more example of
 what makes Usenet such an interesting social experiment.</p>
