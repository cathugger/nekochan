<div class="intro">
 <p class="first">Since writing my unexpectedly popular essay
  "<a href="yenc.html">Why yEnc is Bad For Usenet</a>," I've heard
  from quite a lot of people about <a href="http://www.yenc.org/">yEnc</a>.
  Unfortunately, there seem to be a number of widespread misconceptions about
  yEnc, what it is, how it works, and why it's bad (or why it's good). Since my
  essay is so widely cited by yEnc opponents who often agree with me for the
  wrong reasons, I figure it's about time I clear some of this up.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
 <h2>yEnc is not compression</h2>

 <p>The most widespread misconception about yEnc is that it's a file compression
  system, like jpeg or mp3.  This seems to be due to all the talk about the
  smaller posts.</p>

 <p>yEnc <em>doesn't</em> make files smaller. It is not a replacement for zip, or
  jpeg, or mp3.  It's an encoding format, designed to make files safe for NNTP
  (Usenet) transport, as a replacement for uuencode. Don't be confused by all
  the talk of smaller files; yEnc makes files larger, not smaller, it just
  doesn't make them as large as uuencode does.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
 <h2>yEnc does not affect quality</h2>

 <p>Many people are under the impression that, because yEnc posts are smaller,
  the files are of lower quality. With lossy compression schemes like jpeg and
  mp3, smaller files generally translate to lower quality, because more
  information is lost in the compression.</p>

 <p>As noted above, yEnc has nothing to do with compression systems like jpeg
  or mp3. When a file is posted using yEnc, it is still compressed in the same
  way it was before, and the decoded file will be exactly the same whether yEnc
  or uuencode is used. yEnc absolutely does <em>not</em> result in lower quality
  pictures or sound.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
 <h2>yEnc does not carry viruses</h2>

 <p>No, really, I've heard from a number of people who blame yEnc for
  infecting their systems with viruses. Some people also claim that, since yEnc
  uses less encoding then uuencode, that it is more vulnerable to a virus
  infecting a file in transit.  This is, of course, total nonsense.</p>

 <p>If you download a program from Usenet, and run it, and you get a virus,
  it had <em>nothing</em> to do with which encoding method was used to post
  the program. It had everything to do with downloading executable
  programs from random sources like newsgroups and then running them, which
  is one of the best ways to get a virus. If the program that finally trashed
  your system just happened to be one of the first yEnc posts you downloaded,
  that was a coincidence. If you're using Windows, you were going to get hit
  sooner or later.</p>

 <p>There is nothing about yEnc that makes files more (or less) vulnerable to
  viruses.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
 <h2>yEnc does not hurt propagation</h2>

 <p>A recurring complaint about yEnc is that posts made with it suffer from
  poorer propagation than posts made with uuencode. Reasons cited range from
  transit servers not yet implementing yEnc support (which, of course, they
  don't have to) to the smaller encoding making the post more likely to get
  lost.</p>

 <p>Yes, it's true that sometimes yEnc posts fail to propagate well. The
  most common cause, however, is posters using line counts to determine
  part size.</p>

 <p>Usenet was designed for text posts, and a line count makes sense for giving
  a human an idea of how big a text post is. People can relate to line counts.</p>

 <p>However, line count has nothing to do with the actual size of a post or a
  file, because it says nothing about the length of each of the lines. A post
  at 5000 lines in yEnc is much larger than a post at 5000 lines in uuencode,
  because yEnc uses longer lines. Indeed, because line lengths in yEnc can vary,
  there is no way to translate a line count into a size. (Line lengths can vary
  in uuencode as well, but in practice they almost never do.)</p>

 <p>So, if someone posts a file split into parts by line count, using yEnc,
  and forgets to take the longer lines into account, each of those parts may
  end up being a couple of megabytes in size, large enough to be rejected by
  most servers. The same count using uuencode would result in articles well
  under the one meg limit of most servers. Thus, the yEnc post gets bad
  propagation, but the cause isn't the encoding, it's the size of the parts.</p>

 <p>It is important that binary posting programs stop using line counts to
  determine article size. Newsreaders designed for binary downloading should
  show the article size in bytes, which is available from the overview just
  as the line count is.  yEnc has made line counts even less meaningful
  than they always were.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
 <h2>Modem compression doesn't negate yEnc</h2>

 <p>A lot of people wonder if the bandwidth savings of yEnc are an illusion,
  due to modem hardware compression. The reasoning goes like this: a yEnc
  file, being closer in content to the original, already-compressed file,
  cannot be compressed well. A uuencoded file, on the other hand, can be
  compressed significantly. Thus, the savings of yEnc are offset by the
  inability to compress the data while downloading it.</p>

 <p>This is not the case.  While it's true that uuencoded files compress much
  better than yEnc files, yEnc is still at least 10% smaller than uuencode
  after v.42 compression is applied.</p>

 <p>In addition, only modem users get line compression.  Downloads over other
  connection types, such as ISDN, cable, or DSL, are not compressed for
  transmission.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
 <h2>yEnc does not require ISP support</h2>

 <p>Your ISP or Usenet provider does not need to do anything special to support
  yEnc.  As far as the servers are concerned, a yEnc post is a post
  like any other.</p>

 <p>One thing ISPs and news providers must do about yEnc is add support
  for it to filters for misplaced binaries.  The binary filters in wide use
  before the spread of yEnc don't recognize a yEnc post as a binary.
  This, however, has no effect on the ability of an end-user to download yEnc
  files.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
 <h2>yEnc doesn't download slower</h2>

 <p>Surprisingly, it's not an uncommon belief that yEnc actually results in
  slower downloads, and thus fails to deliver what it advertises.  This
  perception comes about for the same reason as perceived bad propagation
  of yEnc posts: the misuse of line count as an indication of size.</p>

 <p>Yes, a 3000 line yEnc post will take longer to download than a 3000 line
  uuencoded post.  This is not because yEnc downloads slower, it's because
  3000 lines of yEnc is a lot more data than 3000 lines of uuencode.
  Line count has nothing to do with size and cannot be used as a comparison of
  download times.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
 <h2>yEnc doesn't decrease retention</h2>

 <p>I've heard from some people under the mistaken impression that news
  servers don't recognize yEnc posts as valid and therefore expire them
  more quickly than uuencoded binaries.</p>

 <p>Some servers, such as those used at Supernews, expire posts differently
  based upon whether they are single-part or multi-part binaries (giving
  longer retention to the much larger, and much more popular, single-part
  posts, like the pictures).  There exists some posting software which
  incorrectly places a <b>=ypart</b> header in single-part yEnc posts,
  marking them as multi-part.  So, on servers which expire in this manner,
  those posts (and only those, not all yEnc posts) will be expired as though
  they were multi-part, because the broken posting software claimed they
  were.  This is the fault of the posting software, not of yEnc.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
 <h2>yEnc doesn't increase retention</h2>

 <p>Despite the optimistic predictions of its supporters, yEnc has not resulted in
  any decrease in the volume or growth rate of Usenet traffic.  The growth rate
  before and after the arrival of yEnc has remained pretty much the same.  yEnc
  has had no effect at all on retention times of full-feed news servers.  Of
  course, if the spools are the same size, and yEnc is smaller, this could
  indicate that there is more total "stuff" available now.</p>

 <p>Or it could just be people reposting things in uuencode after they've already
  been posted in yEnc.</p>
