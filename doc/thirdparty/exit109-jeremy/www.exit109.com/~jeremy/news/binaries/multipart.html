		<p>The current MIME specification does not provide a decent way to post <strong>multipart
		 binaries</strong> (where a single file is split into segments and posted in multiple
		 articles because it is too big for a single article). But we can fix that.</p>
		<p>The goals here are to define a specification for transmission of files in
		 multiple messages, and to make it easier for clients (and therefore users) to find
		 what they are looking for. With the current methods, the file is simply split into
		 segments and posted in multiple articles. Clients must use imprecise Subject line
		 parsing to figure out which posts go in the series and in what order. If even one
		 segment of a series is missing, the series is close to useless. Reposts of individual
		 segments are difficult and error-prone, and there are few tools which even attempt it.
		 Finding such a reposted segment and joining it with the rest of the series must be
		 done manually.</p>
		<p>MIME's current message/partial type (described in <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2046.html">RFC 2046</a>)
		 is not really suitable for this purpose. It does not permit 8-bit encodings, so
		 it won't work with the new proposed transfer-encodings. In addition, it was not
		 created for this task and would not provide the desired functionality. The idea
		 is to allow posting of segments of <em>files,</em> not of messages. There is no
		 good reason to insist that a file must be reassembled only from one series of
		 posts. As long as all of the data from a file has been posted, it can be reassembed,
		 even if different portions of it were posted at different times by different people
		 using different encodings and even in different newsgroups. And it should be
		 possible to automate the task of searching for missing segments.</p>
		<p>To this end, we define a new MIME content type, <strong>application/file-fragment</strong>.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="body">
		<h2>application/file-fragment</h2>
		<p>The MIME type application/file-fragment specifies that a MIME body contains a
		 <strong>fragment</strong> of a larger file. The segment must be contiguous. A collection
		 of application/file-fragment entities can be created by splitting the original, raw
		 datastream at whatever intervals are appropriate, and encoding the result with some
		 transfer-encoding in order to include it in a MIME entity. The divisions must occur
		 at least on byte boundaries. It may be desirable to only create divisions on boundaries
		 of multiples of four bytes.  (The datastream should be considered an octet-stream, not
		 a bit-stream.) The segments in a series need not all be the same size.</p>
		<p>For the purposes of this specification, the term <em>series</em> refers to a sequence
		 of posts, done all at once, containing fragments of the same file. A complete series
		 contains all of the data from the original file, and an incomplete series contains only
		 some of the data (as in the case of a partial repost).  A complete series should contain
		 the data in sequence; that is, the data in part number two should be that immediately
		 after the data in part number one.</p>
		<h3>Parameters</h3>
		<p>application/file-fragment defines the following parameters.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>name</strong></dt>
			<dd>Specifies the name of the file. This must have the same value in all messages in
			 a series, and is required.  (However, implementations should be careful about blindly
			 using the specified filename when saving data to disk.)</dd>
			<dt><strong>offset</strong></dt>
			<dd>Specifies the starting point of this fragment, in bytes, within the original
			 (unencoded) data of which this fragment is part. Offsets are zero-based (the first
			 byte in the file is at offset zero). This parameter is required.</dd>
			<dt><strong>length</strong></dt>
			<dd>The length, in bytes, of the unencoded data represented by this fragment.  This
			 parameter is required.</dd>
			<dt><strong>filesize</strong></dt>
			<dd>Specifies the total size of the complete file of which this entity is a fragment.
			 This parameter is optional, but encouraged.</dd>
			<dt><strong>number</strong></dt>
			<dd>Where this fragment falls in sequence, in this series of posts. This parameter
			 is required if the fragment is being posted as part of a series, whether or not the
			 series is complete with regard to the original file.  If a single fragment of a file
			 is being posted, it need not be used.  (Thus, if not present, its value should be
			 assumed to be 1.)</dd>
			<dt><strong>total</strong></dt>
			<dd>The total number of fragments in this series of posts. As with number, this
			 parameter is required unless this is the only fragment of the file being posted.
			 (Thus, if not present, its value should be assumed to be 1.)</dd>
			<dt><strong>id</strong></dt>
			<dd>Semantically identical to a message-id, this is a unique identifier for the
			 series of posts. It must be the same in all posts comprising a series. This parameter
			 is required in any series, and optional if only a single fragment is being posted.
			 It can be used by a client to locate other posts in a particular series, and can be
			 used to distinguish between multiple posts of the same file. It should <em>not</em>
			 be the same as any message-id of any post in a series.  (The reason this parameter
			 is required is to allow automated searching for other posts in a series by clients.)</dd>
			<dt><strong>md5</strong></dt>
			<dd>Contains the MD5 checksum (as in Content-MD5) of the full, reassembled, decoded,
			 original file of which this fragment is a part. This can be used by a client to verify
			 the integrity of the final, decoded file. It can also be used to locate different
			 posts of the same file (reposts) in order to fill in &quot;gaps&quot; in in the file,
			 even if the reposts were done with a different filename, and can be used to
			 differentiate between different files posted under the same filename. It must be the
			 same in all posts in a series, and is required (the reason it is required is to allow
			 automated searching for fragments of a desired file by clients).</dd>
			<dt><strong>type</strong></dt>
			<dd>Specifies the MIME type of the full file.  This parameter is optional, and should
			 only be included where appropriate (that is, if the value will not provide any useful
			 information to a client, as in the case of application/octet-stream, it should not be
			 specified).  If it is not present, the file should be treated as type application/octet-stream.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>As an example of what such a header might look like, with all parameters given (broken onto multiple lines for readability):</p>
		<p class="samp"><samp>Content-Type: application/file-fragment; name=foo.pdf; offset=0; length=500000;<br>filesize=7500000; number=1; total=15; id=&quot;&lt;ad438c$89ef@example.com&gt;&quot;;<br>md5=7c595c4ea2befbd6f9d0658506207438; type=application/pdf</samp></p>
		<p>In addition to the Content-Type header, each application/file-fragment should have a
		 Content-MD5 header which contains an MD5 checksum of the (decoded) data contained within
		 that fragment. This can be used to detect corrupt fragments, so that a client can discard
		 them and look for another post containing the needed data. Content-MD5 is described in
		 <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1864.html">RFC 1864</a>. Since the checksum is taken
		 from the original data, it should survive recoding to a different transfer-encoding.</p>
		<p>A description of the file can be included in the Content-Description header (defined in
		 <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2045.html">RFC 2045</a>). If it is used in a series
		 (whether complete or incomplete with regard to the original file), it must be present in
		 the first post in that series, and is optional in the other segments (and would be
		 redundant in them). This way, a client looking for a description of the file need only
		 check the headers of the first post in the series.</p>
		<p>A Content-Disposition header, if present, should <em>not</em> contain the filename of
		 the original file; the header is meant to describe only the entity within that one message,
		 so it does not apply for that purpose.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="body">
		<h2>Usage</h2>
		<p>Given the above specification, we can post a file in a series of articles, using any
		 encoding we want, and the file can be reassembled as long as a client has enough
		 fragments to represent all of the data in the original file.  Overlaps in data between
		 fragments are allowed and should be expected; they should not occur within a single
		 full series, but can happen in the case of reposts.</p>
		<p>A client can use the md5 parameter of the Content-Type header to locate other posts
		 containing fragments of the same file, and can also use it to determine whether the user
		 already has the file, even if it is being posted under a different filename (if the
		 implementation includes a feature to keep track of files downloaded). It can use the id
		 parameter to locate other posts within the same series, and it will know from the total
		 parameter how many pieces it is looking for.</p>
		<p>A binary downloading client could work like this. It enters a group as usual. Then,
		 instead of downloading the possibly huge and certainly redundant overview for the group,
		 it uses XHDR to retrieve the Content-Type headers from the posts in the group. Now it has
		 enough information to present the user with a list of files available in the group. It
		 also has enough information to automatically locate missing fragments of a file it is
		 attempting to download, and to determine if the user already has any of the files, even
		 under a different name.</p>
		<p>When the client presents the user with a list of available files, a user could then
		 have the option of requesting more information about a file. The client would then
		 retrieve the headers (or XOVER information, or just a subset of the headers such as
		 Content-Description) from the first article in the series (the post with the same id
		 parameter as the others, where the value of the number parameter is 1). This would
		 reveal the From, Subject, Content-Description, and other information about the series.
		 In a multipart group, the overhead of even automatically doing this on the first post
		 in every series in the group would be minimal. The end result is that scanning newsgroups
		 for items of interest would be faster, not to mention far more functional, than simply
		 downloading the full overview in every group (a procedure which was designed for, and is
		 mostly functional for, discussion groups).  Although the Content-Type header we end up
		 with is not exactly tiny, it is significantly smaller than a full overview entry.</p>
 		<p>In addition, automated searching for missing fragments is possible, and will work even
 		 if the missing fragments are located as part of a different series, or if they are in a
 		 different newsgroup. A client could be configured to scan several different groups for
 		 fragments of a file, for example if a newsgroup has a companion &quot;reposts&quot;
 		 group. Since several groups could be scanned with this method in the same time it would
 		 take to scan one group the &quot;old&quot; way, actually scanning a larger number of
 		 newsgroups becomes possible.  In fact, if a client wants only to search a group for
 		 desired fragments of a file, it can employ XPAT to perform the search without even
 		 needing to download the Content-Type headers for the group.</p>
 	</div>

	<div class="body">
		<h2>Notes on server implementations</h2>
		<p>A small number of current NNTP server implementations restrict the set of headers
		 available to the NNTP XHDR and XPAT commands to those in the overview index.  This
		 behavior will obviously break the above method of scanning newsgroups, and generally
		 cause problems for this specification.  Such servers should be modified to allow XHDR
		 and XPAT on at least the Content-Type header.  This can be achieved without sacrifice
		 in performance, and with only a very small overhead in the indexes, by simply indexing
		 that header along with the overview headers, but not returning it in the XOVER output.</p>
		<p>In addition, some current implementations suffer a performace hit when running XHDR
		 and XPAT commands on non-overview headers.  It would be desirable for such implementations
		 to index Content-Type as suggested above.</p>
		<p>Aside from the above small problems, the methods in this specification should work,
		 without changes, on <em>most</em> existing NNTP servers.  Servers which do not allow
		 the XPAT command (there are a few) would present a problem for a client wishing to
		 perform server-side searches without downloading the full list of Content-Type headers
		 (for example, if searching multiple groups for desired fragments of a file), but would
		 otherwise work.  Servers which do not implement XHDR at all, or which restrict it to
		 overview headers and will not change their implementation, would simply not work with this
		 specification, and should be considered unsuitable for binary downloading.</p>
		<p>While this is clearly a drawback to this specification, I feel it is a worthwhile
		 tradeoff against continuing to expect clients to download full overviews in all groups
		 even when they don't need most of the information contained in them.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="body">
		<h2>Transition period</h2>
		<p>Obviously, there will be a transition period in which many posts will still be made
		 using the old methods.  Clients should continue to use the Subject headers from a
		 group to assemble multiparts until there is no good reason to continue doing so.
		 Implementations are discouraged, however, from <em>generating</em> those Subject line
		 formats, in order not to encourage the continued use of those methods.</p>
		<p>Note that the time-saving method of avoiding a full overview download can still be
		 employed while Subject lines are in use. A client can use XHDR to retrieve Subject
		 headers from the group as well as Content-Type headers during the transition period
		 in order to avoid a full overview download.  This will result in a higher overhead
		 than only using the one header, but one hopes the transition period can be short (as
		 evidenced by the overnight acceptance of yEnc).</p>
		<p>In addition, during a transition period, it can be expected that many clients will
		 not understand the application/file-fragment type.  The MIME spec states that unknown
		 application types should be treated as application/octet-stream, so this should not
		 cause any actual problems with clients.  But it is desirable during a transition
		 period for users to be able to decode these messages using external decoders.</p>
		<p>Any newsreader which is capable of saving a raw, unmodified article to disk would
		 be suitable for use with an external decoding application.  In addition, most (or
		 possibly all) Unix newsreaders are capable of piping an article directly into another
		 program.  However, mere saving of the application/file-fragment data is <em>not</em>
		 sufficient for an external decoder to work, because the necessary metadata would be
		 lost in that process.  The message headers must be saved along with the body.</p>
