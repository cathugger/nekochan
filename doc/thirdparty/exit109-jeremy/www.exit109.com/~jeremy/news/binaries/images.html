		<p>This page presents a specific example of extending the base
		 <a href="posting.html">binary-posting specification</a> to add new features.
		 Similar extensions could be created for other types of media or other kinds
		 of feature additions.</p>
		<p>Here, I specify a way of posting pictures to Usenet which allows clients
		 to create thumbnail displays of the pictures available in a newsgroup without
		 needing to download the full pictures first (similar to the functionality you
		 would get on the kind of web-based thumbnail display featured by services like
		 Easynews).  It also allows users to determine whether they already have a given
		 picture (even under a different filename).  In many picture newsgroups, reposting
		 images under different filenames is a common complaint.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="body">
		<h2>Thumbnail posts</h2>
	 	<p>Currently, thumbnail posts are generally done by simply creating an image of
	   thumbnails and posting it along with a series of pictures.  The thumbnail image
	   shows the filenames of the pictures, so a user can look through the Subject lines
	   to find the posts containing the pictures he wants.  Surely there must be a better
	   way.</p>
	  <p>What we want from thumbnail posts is twofold.  First, a way for a client to
	   automatically determine that a post contains thumbnails.  And second, a way to
	   connect each thumbnail to the original, full-sized picture it represents.</p>
	  <p>Both goals can be acheived with MIME.  We define a new MIME content-type,
	   <strong>multipart/thumbnails</strong>.  This type is similar to multipart/related.</p>
	  <p>The thumbnail post may contain an (optional) text part including descriptive
	   text about the picture series it represents.  Then, it contains a number
	   of image parts (usually jpeg, but this is not required), one for each thumbnail.</p>
	  <p>(Existing MIME-compliant software should treat an unknown multipart type as
	   multipart/mixed, and should therefore still be somewhat usable. A post of this
	   type will be of little utility to a client which does not understand it, but such
	   a client would, at the least, still be able to present the text description to
	   the user, and may even display the thumbnail images.)</p>
	  <p>The following parameter is defined for multipart/thumbnails.</p>
	  <dl>
	  	<dt><strong>start</strong></dt>
	  	<dd>Contains the Content-ID of the entity within the message which provides
	  	 a description of the picture series, if one is included.  This entity can be
	  	 a text entity, or a multipart/alternative entity including text parts.
	  	 (This parameter works like it does in multipart/related.)</dd>
	  </dl>
	  <p>If the description is in HTML, or an HTML part within a multipart/alternative
		 part, it can refer to the thumbnail parts in the same manner as with
		 multipart/related, and a client can choose to render it as the thumbnail display
		 if it wishes to do so.  However, it need not do so, in particular if displaying
		 thumbnails for multiple sets of images at once.</p>
	  <p>Each image entity within the multipart/thumbnails message will have several
	   important pieces of information in its header.</p>
	  <dl>
	  	<dt><strong>Content-Description</strong></dt>
	  	<dd>The Content-Description header contains descriptive text about the image,
	  	 which can be displayed to the user as a caption. If HTML is used in the
	  	 description part, this should still be present for use when a client does
	  	 not choose to render the display that way (which it might do if presenting
	  	 a display of multiple sets of thumbnails) if a caption for the thumbnail
	  	 is desired.  This parameter is, however, optional.</dd>
	  	<dt><strong>Original-File-Message-ID</strong></dt>
	  	<dd>A header containing the message-id of the article containing the full-sized
	  	 version of the image, to be used by a client to retrieve the post.  If the image
	  	 has been posted as a multipart post (more than one post), this should specify
	  	 the message-id of the first part in the series.</dd>
	  	<dt><strong>Original-File-MD5</strong></dt>
	  	<dd>A header containing the MD5 checksum of the original (full-sized) image.  This
	  	 can be used to determine whether the user already has the image (even under a
	  	 different name), or to detect alteration of the original image.</dd>
	  	<dt><strong>Original-Filename</strong></dt>
	  	<dd>Contains the filename of the original (full-sized) image.  This should be the
	  	 same as the filename specified in the full post. If the thumbnail has a filename
	  	 specified in a Content-Disposition header, and that filename is the same as the
	  	 name of the original picture, then this is optional. Posting clients are strongly
	  	 encouraged to provide a filename, but it is not required.</dd>
	  </dl>
	  <p>Given the above, a client can find all the thumbnail posts in a group.  It can
	   then display a screen of thumbnail images, including filenames and captions, along
	   with text descriptions for any sets which include one in the thumbnail post.  A
	   user could then click on one of the images to download the corresponding full
	   post, since the client would have the message-id of that post.</p>
		<p>A client could, therefore, show thumbnails of an entire picture group (assuming
		 thumbnail posts are used in the group) <em>without</em> needing to download the
		 group's overviews (headers) first.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="body">
		<h2>Image posts</h2>
		<p>For the full image posts, it is desirable to have a &quot;link&quot; to the
		 corresponding thumbnail post, so a user who sees one of the pictures first can
		 find the thumbnails for the set it goes with.  In this case, it is not of great
		 importance where the information is placed, so we can simply add a header to the
		 post for it.  So, a post of an image which has a corresponding thumbnail post
		 can have an <strong>X-Thumbnail-Post</strong> header containing the message-id
		 of the thumbnail post.  Implementations must recognize this also as Thumbnail-Post
		 (no X- prefix), which may be the specified form in the future, but for now, it
		 must be generated with the prefix.</p>
		<p>Note that this creates two posts which refer to each other by message-id.  This
		 will require that the client creates the message-ids for the posts, because that is
		 the only way to know ahead of time what the ids will be.  My suggestion, if a client
		 wishes to use X-Thumbnail-Post, would be to post the full images first, having
		 decided on a message-id to use for the thumbnail post.  While posting the images,
		 the client could build a list of message-ids corresponding to each image.  Then,
		 it could create the thumbnail post and send it.  This procedure would be easiest
		 even if the client does not wish to refer back to the thumbnail post from the
		 full posts.</p>
		<p>A very small number of servers do not allow client-supplied message-ids.  I am
		 aware of two such servers, and at least one of them does not even inform the client
		 of the message-id it has decided to use for the post (it just silently changes a
		 client-supplied id).  This is unfortunate behavior which servers should not engage
		 in (for reasons which go way beyond this specification), but unless they change,
		 those servers would simply be considered unsuitable for posting of images.  Even
		 more unfortunately, there is no way for a client to automatically know that a server
		 is going to discard client-supplied ids.</p>
