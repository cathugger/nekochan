  <p>My essay <a href="http://www.exit109.com/%7ejeremy/news/yenc.html">Why yEnc is
   bad for Usenet</a> raised the idea that what we need is &quot;a better way to post
   binaries on Usenet.&quot; However, that idea itself raises the question, &quot;what
   is a better way?&quot; My answer is in these pages.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="warning">
  <p>Because of the mess caused by yEnc, I am going to say this right up front:
   This is a work in progress, <em>not</em> a finished standard.
   <em><strong>Do not implement these ideas in production software!</strong></em>
   Whatever standard may emerge is virtually guaranteed <em>not</em> to be
   exactly what is on this page, so please don't turn all of Usenet into
   beta-testers like yEnc did.  If you like the ideas presented here, please
   come to news.software.nntp and join the discussion.  Feel free to write
   test implementations, but please don't encourage people to use this stuff
   on Usenet in general at this point in time.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="body">
  <p>To define a better way to post binaries, there are three areas we must
   address.  My goal is to do this entirely within the existing MIME specification,
   rather than requiring changes to the spec first.  Basing
   the design upon needed changes to the spec would, at the very least, make this
   a much longer process, and may doom it to failure.</p>
  <p>Due to the nature of MIME, we can look at each of the three areas individually.
   In addition, I have a fourth section, giving a specific example of how the basic
   ideas can be extended to add media-specific additional features.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="body">
  <h2><a href="encoding.html"><img src="transfer.gif" alt="Transfer encoding" border="0" width="174" height="56"></a></h2>
  <p>The main selling point of yEnc is its <strong>smaller encoding</strong>. The
   bloat of uuencode and base64 is unnecessary on Usenet, where the channels of
   transmission are very nearly 8-bit clean. By defining a smaller encoding within
   MIME, we can take advantage of this, without giving up all the goodies MIME
   makes possible.</p>
  <p>To take advantage of existing code and gain full backwards compatibility with existing newsreaders, we can define <a href="encoding.html">yEnc as a MIME transfer-encoding</a>.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="body">
  <h2><a href="posting.html"><img src="posting.gif" alt="Binary posting" border="0" width="156" height="56"></a></h2>
  <p>Binaries (single-part ones, at least) can be <strong>posted using MIME</strong>
   right now. However, the process could benefit from a more detailed specification.
   If posting agents were to adopt a consistent set of methods, the entire process
   could be made faster and easier for the users, and additional features could easily
   be added on top of the basic specification.</p>
  <p>In this section, I present a proposed set of guidelines for
   <a href="posting.html">how clients should post binaries to Usenet</a>. This includes
   several small additions to MIME (but is mainly a description of how to work within the
   current specification), and serves as a basis we can then extend to support multipart
   binaries as well as other added features.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="body">
  <h2><a href="multipart.html"><img src="multipart.gif" alt="Multipart binaries" border="0" width="172" height="56"></a></h2>
  <p>When files are too large to post in a single article, they are split up and
   <strong>posted in segments</strong>.  In this section, I propose a
   <a href="multipart.html">new MIME content type</a> for transmission of files in
   multiple segments.  The goals are to enable reliable and automatic reassembly of
   files; automatic searching for and identification of missing file segments;
   partial reposts, even by third parties; automatic identification and use of later
   reposts (including partial reposts) even under different filenames; automatic
   location of metadata such as textual descriptions of files; and faster scanning
   of newsgroups for items of interest.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="body">
  <h2><a href="images.html"><img src="images.gif" alt="Posting images" border="0" width="156" height="56"></a></h2>
  <p>Finally, I present a detailed example of the kind of media-specific features
   that can be added to the basic posting specification to make it even <strong>more useful</strong>.
   This is a proposed specification for <a href="images.html">posting images to Usenet</a>
   which enables clients to show thumbnails of the pictures available in a newsgroup,
   and allow the user to retrieve the full pictures from them.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="body">
  <p><strong>NEW:</strong> here's a note about the <a href="status.html">current status</a> of this project.</p>
  <p>I have created these specifications in the hope that, if they don't suck, they
   will provide some benefit to Usenet as a whole.  I place no proprietary restrictions
   on the use of the ideas, methods, or algorithms here, or anything silly like that.</p>
  <p>There is sample code available implementing yEnc as a MIME transfer encoding. See the <a href="encoding.html">encoding page</a>.</p>
