		<p>A new <strong>transfer-encoding</strong> for Usenet binary posts is based
		 on the simple premise that NNTP transport is <em>nearly</em> 8-bit-clean.  The data
		 is assumed by most implementations to be line-oriented, and although there
		 is no specified limit to the length of lines, in practice they should be
		 restricted to no more than 1000 characters including the trailing CRLF pair.
		 It follows that CR and LF cannot be present in the body of a message other
		 than as a CRLF line-termination sequence. NULL cannot be present in a message,
		 because many implementations will not deal with it correctly. A dot at the
		 start of a line should be escaped, because NNTP implementations often get
		 dot-escaping wrong. Finally, the encoding needs to be prepared to deal with
		 software adding blank lines to the end of messages, or servers which append
		 signatures to all posts.</p>
		<p>Usenet can, in practice, safely transmit messages created within the above
		 restrictions.  In addition, those restrictions ensure better compliance with
		 MIME in general, in preparation for the case where messages using our new
		 encoding may end up in systems other than Usenet.  However, to be on the safe
		 side, and better prepared for messages ending up in email (as they would if
		 posted to a moderated newsgroup), an encoding specification should be prepared
		 to prevent the occurance of certain things within the post-encoding data.</p>
 		<p>Specifically, a relay agent may want to encode trailing spaces on lines; TAB
 		 characters; and the sequence &quot;From &quot; (the last character is a space)
 		 at the beginning of a line, in order to ensure safe passage for a message through
 		 email-based systems. So, an encoding scheme should be able to do this, though it
 		 may not want to when simply posting to Usenet, where such sequences are not
 		 generally a problem.  (In actual practice, it would be best to never transmit an
 		 attachment encoded with this method via email, but rather to transcode it to base64 first.)</p>
 		<p>To find a good encoding method, we need look no further than yEnc.  The encoding
 		 scheme used in yEnc meets the above criteria, and can be used as a MIME
 		 transfer-encoding.</p>

  	<h2>yEnc in MIME</h2>
  	<p>yEnc's encoding method is suitable for use as a transfer-encoding, and has
  	 the additional advantage of already being widely implemented.  With a small effort,
  	 we can make yEnc MIME messages fully backwards-compatible with current yEnc
  	 decoding implementations -- in other words, these messages can be decoded by
  	 <em>existing</em> newsreaders.  This helps greatly with a transition period.</p>
  	<p>To use yEnc within MIME, we implement it as a transfer-encoding to encode the
  	 data of a MIME entity.  Implementations can generate the header/trailer lines,
  	 but would ignore them upon decoding.  The presence of the header/trailer lines
  	 is what gives us backwards-compatibility.  (Unfortunately, it does make the
  	 implementation somewhat more difficult as well.)  Clients which do not implement
  	 the new transfer-encoding would still be able to decode the message if they have
  	 implemented &quot;old-fashioned&quot; yEnc decoding.  If not, they could still
  	 use an external decoding program, because MIME implementations are required to
  	 treat entities with unknown transfer-encodings as an application/octet-stream,
  	 which means they won't touch the data.</p>
  </div>
 
	<div class="body">
		<h2>The algorithm</h2>
		<p>The basic algorithm for yEnc-within-MIME encoding is presented below. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.yenc.org/">yEnc website</a>.</p>
		<h3>The header line</h3>
		<p>yEnc data begins with a header line, starting with <strong>=ybegin</strong>
		 with several parameters following.  A header line looks like:</p>
		<p><samp>=ybegin line=990 size=9556 name=example.jpg</samp></p>
		<p>The <strong>line</strong> parameter specifies the target line length for the
		 encoded data.  The <strong>size</strong> parameter specifies the size in bytes
		 of the original (unencoded) file.  The <strong>name</strong> parameter gives the
		 suggested filename for the file.</p>
		<p>This header line exists <em>only</em> for the purpose of backwards-compatibility
		 with existing (non-MIME) yEnc implementations, and MUST be ignored by decoders.
		 Adding it at encoding time is optional but strongly encouraged during the early
		 stages of adoption of this specification.</p>
		<p>There is another header line, <strong>=ypart</strong>, which exists
		 for the purpose of multipart (split) binaries.  This will be addressed in a future
		 revision of this page as we begin to better address multipart posts.</p>
		<h3>The footer line</h3>
		<p>The footer line begins with <strong>=yend</strong> and is followed
		 by two parameters.  The first, <strong>size</strong>, again gives the size of the
		 unencoded file.  The second, <strong>crc32</strong>, is an optional parameter
		 giving the CRC32 checksum of the data.</p>
		<p>In this specification, the <strong>=yend</strong> sequence (at the start of a line) is
		 considered an end-of-data marker.  Decoders should stop upon reaching it.  Encoders
		 should add it to the end of their data.  The parameters exist <em>only</em> for the
		 purpose of backwards-compatibility, and decoders implementing this standard MUST
		 ignore them.  The <strong>size</strong> parameter is optional but strongly encouraged
		 during the early stages of adoption of this standard.  The crc32 parameter is optional.</p>
		<h3>The encoding</h3>
		<p>Data is encoded by the following algorithm.  For each byte of input data, add 42 to
		 the value, modulo 256.  If the result is the value of a character which must be encoded
		 in the output stream, first write the escape character ("=", an equals sign), then
		 add 64 to the value of the byte, modulo 256, and write that value.</p>
		<p>Characters which must be encoded are NULL, CR, LF, and "=" (equals sign, the
		 escape character), and a dot (period) if it appears at the beginning of a line
		 in the encoded data.</p>
		<p>A CRLF line-termination sequence should be inserted periodically to keep line lengths
		 under 1000 characters.  The target line length as specified in the =ybegin line
		 does <em>not</em> include the CRLF pair.  It may be exceeded by one in order to write
		 both characters of an escape sequence; an escape sequence may not be broken over two
		 lines.  Decoders must be prepared to decode any value following an escape charcter
		 (not just the ones listed above), and must ignore any CR or LF values in the encoded
		 data.</p>
		<p>Any line starting with <strong>=y</strong> must be ignored by decoders,
		 except the <strong>=yend</strong> sequence which indicates end-of-data.</p>
		<p>As long as the parameters on the <strong>=y</strong> lines are given, messages
		 formatted according to this specification can be decoded by already-existing
		 yEnc decoders.</p>

		<h2>Sample code</h2>
		<p>Sample test code is available here implementing yEnc as a MIME transfer-encoding.
		 It is written in Perl, and works with the MIME-tools package which is available
		 on CPAN.  It should be considered suitable for testing and experimentation only;
		 it is not production-quality code.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="warning">
		<h2>Check your code!</h2>
		<p>Encodings of the type described above expose a frequent bug in existing MIME implementations.
		 Specifically, clients often make mistakes regarding the final CRLF sequence in a body.
		 According to the specification, in a top-level root entity, the final CRLF in the body is
		 considered part of the entity's data. However, in a leaf entity (a part within a multipart
		 message), the trailing CRLF is <em>not</em> considered part of the data.  Many newsreaders
		 appear to get this wrong in one or the other case.  With base64 encoding, CRLF is ignored
		 completely, so the bug has no effect.  However, with a mostly-8-bit encoding, this can
		 cause corruption in decoded files.  The end-of-data escape sequence defined above should
		 work around this bug, and the specification indicates that CR and LF should be ignored
		 by decoders in any event.</p>
		<p>MIME implementations in clients should still be checked to ensure they get this right.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="body">
		<h2>Backwards compatibility</h2>
		<p>MIME makes it intentionally difficult to introduce new transfer-encodings, for the simple
		 reason that software which is not updated to understand it won't know what to do with it.
		 For example, a gateway which would need to transcode 8-bit data into a 7-bit encoding won't
		 know how to do so if it doesn't understand the encoding in which the data arrives.</p>
		<p>The MIME specification states that implementations should treat messages with
		 unknown encodings as an opaque application/octet-stream.  Thus, use of one of these
		 new encodings should simply result in the case where a message can be saved for later
		 processing by an external decoder.  In the case of a gateway wanting to send the message
		 over a 7-bit transmission path, the gateway should reject the message if it cannot
		 recode it (which it can't if it doesn't implement yEnc).  Software which does not
		 behave this way can be considered broken, but may exist, so during a testing phase
		 it would be wise to determine how existing software will react to the introduction
		 of this kind of 8-bit encoding.  This problem, if it arises, is expected mainly in
		 the area of gateways and other non-Usenet or non-NNTP modes of transit.  Since such
		 transmission paths are highly unlikely to be currently carrying binary Usenet traffic,
		 this should not be a large issue.</p>
		<p>The one exception to the above is the case of moderated newsgroups, where posts to
		 the group are actually forwarded to the group moderator via email.  It is impossible
		 to determine what kinds of software are in use on every possible line of transmission
		 for submissions to moderated newsgroups.  Therefore, it is <em>strongly</em> encouraged
		 that yEnc not be used when forwarding submissions to moderators via email
		 in the general case.  Clients are encouraged to fall back to base64 when posting to
		 moderated groups, and servers are encouraged to recode yEnc messages into base64 before
		 forwarding them to moderators.  In practice, the number of moderated binary groups
		 is rather small, so this, too, is likely to be only a very small issue.</p>
